__Important:__ I am not a doctor (and not a programmer) and cant give you any warranties, __use it on your own risk__. I did it for my self, and happy to share it here with someone also in souch need.

This app has different modes which helps you to:
 * train more "lasy" eye
 * accustom your brain for binocular vision
 * expand fusional area
 * improve eyes movability
 
To use the app you will need:
 * a smartphone (the app is operated by touchscreen)
 * any 3d/VR glasses like DIY Google-cardboard for example. Best if you have an easy access to your screen by finger to operate the app

First of all you should make initial settings:
 * run the app: [Start](https://bolodya75.github.io/eyetrainer/trainer.html) 
 * go to "settings" mode
 * adjust the display scale by sliding upper part of a screen left-right and adjusting sample picture to 54 mm (a bank card standart size)
 * adjust the distance between your eyes by sliding lower part of a screen left-right (size between red lines)
 
 And now you can yse it
